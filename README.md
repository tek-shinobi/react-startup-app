# react-startup-app
React startup app with cleaned up boilerplate.

# install directions
- clone the repo
- cd my_app
- you can either __npm install__ to create the node_modules folder OR __unzip node_modules.zip__ (I prefer unzip because it does not have to redownload all the modules. About 250MB of stuff)
- rename __my_app__ to your app name
